 1. ONE OF TWO. THE QUESTION HAD BEEN AS FOLLOWS: "I THINK I WILL ABANDON THIS PROJECT AS VR AND GAMES ARE NOT WHAT I WANT I GUESS OR DO I?" AND I CAME TO A CONCLUSION THAT I WOULD PREFER UNLIMITED FREEDOMS OF BEHAVIORS AND NOT VR- OR GAMES-ONLY AREAS LIMITED FIELDS. SO CLOSING THE INTERNET DOMAIN ANYWORLDS.APP AND ABANDONING THE PROJECT.

THEREFORE, PROJECT STATUS: ABANDONED.

 2. TWO OF TWO. I STILL LIKE ALL OF THESE PYRAMIDS. PROJECT RESUMED.
